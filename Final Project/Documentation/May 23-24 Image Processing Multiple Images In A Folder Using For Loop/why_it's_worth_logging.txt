Research on 3d models and 3d model voxelization







I included this in the process logging because I was trying to first use the os module to open all files in a folder,
then image process them.

First, I tried to just jump right ahead to placing blocks in minecraft based on pixel location.

I used a website  https://drububu.com/miscellaneous/voxelizer/index.html?out=obj to get the images.

The website already had a demo donut shaped 3d model that was already voxelized (3d model turned into small blocks), and then I just
turned up the quality of the voxelization (so more voxels were added to make the curve of the donut more detailed)

That stuff is in the commented section of the code.
