Checking out Python string padding, Mr. Schellenberg suggested to check it out.

Going to use rjust to help with formatting the output of my arithmetic-formatter math problems.

I was able to use for loops to determine the longest operand (number) in each arithmetic problem, and that's the last thing I did for the day.

I also used for loops to loop through the list of operators, determine if the problem is addition or subtraction, then append the answers into
a list of answers. 

What's next:
Now the plan is to be determine how far the math operator should be from the second (bottom) operand.

If the second operand is the longest operand in the math problem, then the operator, + or -, will be just 1 space away from the bottom operand)

If the first (top) operand is 4 digits and the second (bottom) operand is 2 digits, then the operator should be 3 spaces away from the bottom
operand.

Examples:
  4030       21
+   21   + 4030
------   ------

So that's
