June 9th, 2023:

Today I'll be creating the operand formatting rules (see "June 8th, 2023" documentation for the details).

Realized that I will have to make every top operand in one string, and every operator with the bottom operand in one string, because
they must be outputted like this:

   282      94      9030
+ 2901    + 20    -    9
------    ----    ------

Every new print statement will make the math problems appear vertically, but they want to be shown together horizontally.

"   282      94      9030"
"+ 2901    + 20    -    9"
"------    ----    ------"
