Today I have finished the converting the hour from 24-hour clock time to 12 hour clock time, and polished up converting the time values to strings part.

I have started making the part of the code that determines what the day of the week it is using list indexing and the same for-loop logic that I used to determine the hour and minute when x amount of time
passes.
