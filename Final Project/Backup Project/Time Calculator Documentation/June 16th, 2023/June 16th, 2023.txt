I finished writing the function and it passed all 12 tests.

Just had an extra space at the end issue again, because if if a day hadn't passed, then the days_passed_msg was an empty string, but before the
empty string there was a space, since the f-string was formatted as f"{hour}:{minute} {AM_or_PM} {days_passed_msg}
												^
So I just added a space in the variable days_passed_msg, so that way if a space was needed, the string would already have a space at the start
of it.

It was a small issue, but the only issue I had, not including a small error here or there.

Moving onto project 3 of 5 in the freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python course, which is the Budget App project.
