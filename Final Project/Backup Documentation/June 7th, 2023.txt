Started the first project I must complete to get the freeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python" certficate
First Project:
Arithmetic Formatter - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter

Used a link I found earlier that wasn't useful at the time, but useful now. Explains how to format strings using f-strings in the article

Article:
https://towardsdatascience.com/tips-and-tricks-to-work-with-text-files-in-python-89f14a755315

The Logic:
    Code:
        for book in library:
            print(f'{book[0]:{10}} {book[1]:{10}} {book[2]:>{7}}')

    Output:
    Author     Topic        Pages
    Twain      Rafting        601
    Feynman    Physics         95
    Hamilton   Mythology      144
