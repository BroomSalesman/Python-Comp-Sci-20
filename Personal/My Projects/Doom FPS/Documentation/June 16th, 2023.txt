Today I am going to create the part of the code that uses the raycasting minimap to draw out everything in an actual game.

I will be learning how to create 3d projection and add that part of my code in the raycasting.py file. I will be using the tutorial I mentioned in the last documentation.
Currently struggling to figure out what's wrong with my ray_casting code. The rays arent appearing on the minimap (it is not actually a minimap,
it is more like a... map that supplies information to the surroundings to create the surroundings, rather than simply being a minimap of the surrounding.
Hard to explain, easier to show.
