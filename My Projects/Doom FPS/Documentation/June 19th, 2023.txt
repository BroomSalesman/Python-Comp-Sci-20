I nested a function inside the __init__(self, game), which was the cause of the ObjectRenderer class not being called because of the load_wall_textures() not working.

See June 18th, 2023 documentation to see the problem I was having in more detail (at the end of June 18th, 2023.txt).

6:00 PM Update:
Now I am writing the code that determines the offset of the textures when viewing from different angles.
This uses trig functions (what's new?) and the code is in the raycasting file and the object_renderer files.

6:50 Update:
wall textures are now drawn

7:00 Update:
Code wasn't working, I spoke too soon.
I just forgot to add brackets before a function call.

Now I will create the code that controls the vertical scaling of the wall texture
The closer you get, the more the wall scales vertically.
 I glitched out of the walls or something like that due to this, because the immense size of the walls drops performance and makes the
 game VERY laggy and glitchy.

Update:
Now the wall is super pixely when I get close up to it, but that is because the player has no size since it is just a dot on a cartesian plane.
This makes the player get really close to the wall, until the player is close to the wall as possible (as if it were as skinny as a noodle)
Now I will create a sacling factor for the size of the player.
This will be in the player.py file.

Update:
Now the walls just disappear if I get too close.

Update:
Now I am adding mouse controls.

Update:
- Sky textures

Update:
- Sprite loading


if I can't debug it... then it's not mine to call... then its... my own to call code... code to call my own?

Then it's not code to call my own... SOOOOOOO ARE YOU READY!?!?!?!?!?!?

MAJOR UPDATE:
LETS MAKE TETRIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kGNs5R-AM8&list=PLi77irUVkDatlbulEY4Kz8O107HO8RGH8&index=3

Never thought I'd say this, but I wish I could just do this on scratch. Wouldn't have the guilt of using a tutorial either, but whatever. I learn what I can.

and abandon what I can't...

Update:
I just realized stating the domain in math is like stating collision rules. Haha.

Oh yeah I can display the tetris pieces on the screen now. I understand the code that is being used, and can easily debug it if needed (so far)

Update:
Been a while, forgot to update, I have finished making fast drop movie in tetris (where if you press the down arrow the piece drops really fast)
Of course, if I've done that, I've also added the gravity, and I am now writing the code to make the pieces stop at the bottom.

Just fixing up some errors in the code then it should work.

Update:
Stacking works, moving onto rotating.
Getting an error here from a line of code that wasn't returning an error before.

Oh AttributeError, where would I be without you?
