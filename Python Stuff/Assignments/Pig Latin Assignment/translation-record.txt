The green! monkey ran over the tree or something like that, and the rabbits were chasing after him because he had stolen their most valuable
possession, the golden carrot which was actually just a normal carrot spray painted gold that was miraculously not rotting. The monkey ran and ran and
ran and ran, and he ran for a while. He was running with a cheeky smile on his face, which was usual for that trouble-maker.
