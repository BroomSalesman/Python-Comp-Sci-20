Just got used to using Python to do stuff in Minecraft, on and off.

Didn't do much for the actual project itself, but did get a feel for block-placing scripts for Minecraft.

Oh, I did manage to break my scriptable server (I have only one server that I can use to script Minecraft, I got it from the github page listed in the book I used)
Never ignite a huge floating mass of TNT blocks in Minecraft, or else your server will refuse to work every time you rejoin it.
