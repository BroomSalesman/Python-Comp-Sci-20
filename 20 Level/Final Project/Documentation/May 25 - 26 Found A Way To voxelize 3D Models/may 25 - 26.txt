More research on voxelization using 3d scan conversion.

Found a source that teaches how to voxelize 3d models using Python.

Got it to work once, I think it has something to do with just being patient so the 3d model can render, becuase code didn't return any error,
but when I changed the code to something else and clicked run, I think it opened the previous code, because it finished rendering after.

Perhaps it was a coincidence?

Lunch:
I am convinced that the code just takes a lot of time to render the 3d models. I looked in Task Manager, and Python spiked all the way up to 11.5 gigabytes
of memory.

Update: It worked! I just have to show patience. But
